3. Create a Class Car that would have the
    following fields: carPrice and color and method
    calculateSalePrice() which should be returning
    a price of the car.
            Create 2 sub classes: Sedan and Truck. The Truck class has a field as weight and has its own
            implementation of calculateSalePrice() method in which returned price is calculated as
    following: if weight>2000 then returned price car should include 10% discount, otherwise 20%  discount.
    The Sedan class has field as length and also-does it its own implementation of calculateSalePrice(): if length of sedan is >20
    feet then returned car price should include 5% discount, otherwise 10% discount
